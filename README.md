# Start with Data Science as an Introduction to Statistical Thinking

Symposium on Data Science and Statistics 2018
Thu, May 17, 10:30 AM - 12:00 PM 
Grand Ballroom G

## Abstract

The introductory statistics course has evolved over the years and taken various 
forms depending on its target audience. In this talk we discuss a data science 
course designed to serve as a gateway to the discipline of statistics, the 
statistics major, and broadly to quantitative studies. The course is intended 
for an audience of students with little to no computing or statistical 
background, and focuses on data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data 
visualization, and effective communication. Unlike most traditional introductory 
statistics courses, this course approaches statistics from a model-based 
perspective and introduces simulation-based and Bayesian inference later in the 
course. A heavy emphasis is placed on reproducibility (with R Markdown) and 
version control and collaboration (with git/GitHub). We will discuss in detail 
the course structure, logistics, and pedagogical considerations as well as give 
examples from the case studies used in the course. We will also share student 
feedback, assessment of the success of the course in recruiting students to the 
statistical science major, and our experience of growing the course from a small 
seminar course for first-year undergraduates to a larger course open to the 
entire undergraduate student body.
